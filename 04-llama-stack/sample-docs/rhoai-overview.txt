Getting Started with RHOAI:

1. Install the Red Hat OpenShift AI operator from the OperatorHub
2. Create a DataScienceCluster resource
3. Access the dashboard through the OpenShift console
4. Create a data science project
5. Launch a Jupyter notebook
6. Start building your models

Common Use Cases:

- Computer Vision: Image classification, object detection
- Natural Language Processing: Text analysis, sentiment analysis
- Predictive Analytics: Forecasting, anomaly detection
- Recommendation Systems: Product recommendations, content filtering
- Time Series Analysis: Trend prediction, pattern recognition

Inference and Model Deployment:

RHOAI provides several options for deploying trained models:

1. Single Model Serving: Deploy individual models with custom runtime
2. Multi-Model Serving: Serve multiple models from a single endpoint
3. Batch Inference: Process large datasets offline
4. Real-time Inference: Low-latency predictions for production applications

Integration with vLLM:

vLLM (Versatile Large Language Model) is a high-performance inference engine optimized for large language models. RHOAI integrates with vLLM to provide:

- Fast inference for transformer models
- Efficient GPU utilization
- Support for popular LLMs like Llama, Mistral, GPT
- Tool calling and function calling capabilities
- JSON mode for structured outputs

Best Practices:

1. Use GPU instances for training deep learning models
2. Implement model versioning from day one
3. Monitor resource usage to optimize costs
4. Use pipelines for reproducible workflows
5. Implement proper data governance and security
6. Regular model retraining to prevent drift
7. Use appropriate hardware for your workload (CPU vs GPU)

Troubleshooting:

- Check pod logs for errors: oc logs <pod-name>
- Verify GPU allocation: oc describe node <node-name>
- Review operator status: oc get csv -n redhat-ods-operator
- Check data science cluster: oc get datasciencecluster
- Monitor resource quotas in your namespace
